                    <p class="important-notice">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE (AS DEFINED BELOW), AS THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CONSTITUTE A BINDING CONTRACT BETWEEN US.</p>

                    <p class="important-notice">IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION FOR U.S. CUSTOMERS: PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU FULLY READ AND UNDERSTAND THESE TERMS AND KEEP THEM FOR FUTURE REFERENCE. THESE TERMS INCLUDE A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND AN AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE DISPUTES BY ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.</p>

                    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>"Mirorra VPN," "we," "us," or "our" refers to Mirorra LLC, with offices at Suite 4180, Mitchell House, 5 Mitchell Street Edinburgh EH6 7BD, Scotland.</p>

                    <p>1.1. Before accessing or using our products, please read these Mirorra VPN Terms of Service (the "Terms" or "Agreement") carefully. Among other things, the Terms outline in detail what we provide you, our customers, and each of our rights and obligations pertaining to your access and use of 'Mirorra VPN' products, services, applications/apps or other offerings, including any Software (as described below), and any associated documentation (collectively, the "Products" or "Services," or individually a "Product" or "Service") that we provide through mobile or desktop applications or websites we operate. By accessing and using our Services, you represent that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms, including any applicable policies and additional terms specified herein, which form a binding contract with us.</p>

                    <p>1.2. We reserve the right to make changes to the Service, including both free and paid features, at any time, with or without prior notice (for instance, you will be able to view any Agreement changes on our website). Your use of the Service after the date such change(s) become effective will constitute your consent to the changed terms. If you disagree with the change(s), you must immediately stop using the Service; otherwise, the new terms will apply to you.</p>

                    <p>1.3. Without limiting, abridging, or modifying the foregoing acceptance of Terms, by using our Services, you acknowledge that you are entering into a binding contract with us and shall be deemed to have expressly read, understood and agreed to be bound by these Terms.</p>

                    <h2>2. Subscription</h2>
                    <p>Our Services are generally made available on a subscription basis, which means you subscribe to receive access to Our Services for a set period of time based on your selection at time of enrollment ("Subscription"), which is typically a one month or one year term ("Subscription Term") in exchange for your payment of the fees that apply to the Subscription Term for the Service you enroll in ("Subscription Fees"). If applicable and you elect to enroll in a Subscription, you will be billed in advance for your Subscription when you enroll, and thereafter on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). The length of your Billing Cycle will depend on the Subscription or Subscription Term you select at the time of enrollment. You agree to pay for the Subscription that you select.</p>

                    <h2>3. Automatic Renewals & Cancellation</h2>
                    <p>3.1. At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew for an additional Subscription Term at the price or Subscription Fee shown in your account, unless you or We have canceled your Subscription at least one (1) day prior to the commencement of your next Billing Cycle.</p>

                    <p>3.2. Subscriptions purchased via Google Play or/and Apple App Store are subject to such stores. You should contact the relevant store to cancel such a subscription. We cannot grant refunds in such cases.</p>

                    <p>3.3. Once We or you have canceled your Subscription, your recurring Subscription Fees for the Services will no longer be charged to the payment method We have on file for your account, and your Subscription will remain active only until the end of the then current Subscription Term.</p>

                    <h2>4. Free Trials</h2>
                    <p>4.1. We may offer limited-time Free Trials at our discretion. Specific terms will be provided at signup or in promotional materials. Free Trials are available only to users who have not used a Free Trial for the same Service in the past 12 months (or as specified at signup). We reserve the right to modify or cancel Free Trials at any time without notice.</p>

                    <p>4.2. To avoid automatic subscription enrollment and charges, you must cancel at least 24 hours before the trial ends through your account dashboard. We will notify you of applicable fees before charging at the end of the trial period.</p>

                    <h2>5. Fee Changes</h2>
                    <p>5.1. We may change the fees that We charge for the Services at any time, at Our sole discretion, provided that We will give you at least thirty (30) days of prior notice of such changes.</p>

                    <p>5.2. If you are using a Free Service, we or the Free Service may deliver Advertisements. You hereby acknowledge and consent that We may deliver Advertisements to overlay a page or as an interstitial. We reserve the right to prevent your access to the Service or continued use thereof if you violate this Agreement, engage in fraud or copyright infringement, or employ an ad-blocking product or other software or mechanism that prevents you from participating in advertising programs, surveys, or other activities that involve delivery of Advertisements or other monetization of the Free Service.</p>

                    <h2>6. Eligibility</h2>
                    <p>Our Services are available to users who are Eligible. "Eligible" means that (i) you are 18 years of age, or above the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction of residence, or (ii) if you have not reached the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction, but have the permission of a legal parent or guardian to use the Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are under 13 years of age, then you are not Eligible and may not use or access the Service at any time, in any manner. By downloading/installing, using, or accessing the Services, you represent and warrant that you are Eligible. Our Services are not available to persons who are not Eligible and will not be made available to any users who were previously suspended, terminated, or removed from the Services by Us.</p>

                    <h2>7. User Accounts, Data & Passwords</h2>
                    <p>You are fully and solely responsible and liable for the content and data you enter into or process through Our Services.
